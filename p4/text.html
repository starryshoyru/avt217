The dogs are taught to search for human scent and dig once they find its strongest source. To simulate a real avalanche emergency, a handler – along with a USA TODAY Sports reporter – climbed into a man-made snow cave that was sealed with snow. Inside was a tight squeeze but quiet and protective from the cold wind outside.

“When an avalanche victim is buried,” said Christiansen, “they don’t have the luxury of being in a snow cave. There’s tons of snow. It’s in their face, it’s in their mouth, it’s in their ears. It’s a terrible place for a victim to be.”

While this cave had no shortage of oxygen, it was not for the claustrophobic, and there was a tremendous sense of relief to hear a dog sniffing outside and see a wet nose bust through the snow.

From outside the cave, the dog looked up at its handler until given the magic word: "Search!"

The animal took off into the powder, walking with its nose to the ground until its head jolted up. The dog found the scent. It got closer and closer to the snow cave until it was certain it had found the source. Once there it began furiously digging, and within minutes from being told "search," the dog had found its victim.

Avalanche rescue dogs are asked to do things that would scare most dogs: fly in helicopters, ride on snowmobiles, walk through deep mountain snow at night with the sun’s reflection off the moon as the main source of light, and get on their handler’s shoulders so they can be skied down the mountain.

Mike Currid, another Subaru scholarship recipient, said his dog, Reagan, has been lowered from chairlifts 60 feet off the ground. The dogs wouldn’t be up for these tasks if they didn’t have faith in their handlers, and the handlers cherish that bond.

Dent, the handler with an Australian cattle dog, put her backpack on the snow to give Momo a perch to sit atop while also keeping her paws off the cold ground. Ripley, a Border Collie, hopped into Joe Baldwin's arms to bundle up in the cold mountain air. Charlie Stewart dug an alcove into the snow for Iggy that kept her protected from the wind and the commotion of skiers, snowmobiles and other dogs.

“She sleeps in my bed at night, we’re best friends,” said Dan Skilling of his dog Tela. “She trusts me so much. If I tell her to do something, she’s going to do it no matter what. And I know that she will always be there for me. The unconditional love and support I get from her means the world.”

And Christiansen said that extends to anybody unlucky to be caught in an avalanche.

“It truly is a bond between an animal and a man helping out another human being," he said.
